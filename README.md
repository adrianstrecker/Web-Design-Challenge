# Web-Design-Challenge
The purpose of this assignment was to build a site displaying a previous analysis using HTML, Bootstrap and CSS. The site includes temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed across the globe.

There are two versions of the site: WebVisualizations and Bootswatch. WebVisualizations uses Bootstrap and custom CSS while Bootswatch uses the <a href="https://bootswatch.com/sandstone/">Sandstone</a> theme from Bootswatch as a template plus personal CSS as well.

The WebVisualizations version can be viewed <a href="https://adrianstrecker.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/WebVisualizations/landing.html">here</a>.

The Bootswatch version can be viewed <a href="https://adrianstrecker.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/Bootswatch/landing.html">here</a>.
