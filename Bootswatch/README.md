# Web-Design-Challenge
The purpose of this assignment was to build a site displaying a previous analysis using HTML, Bootstrap and CSS. The site includes temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed across the globe. This version of the site also uses the <a href="https://bootswatch.com/sandstone/">Sandstone</a> theme from <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a> in addition to Bootstrap and custom CSS.

The site can be accessed <a href="https://adrianstrecker.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/Bootswatch/landing.html">here</a>.
